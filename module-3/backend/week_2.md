## Week Two - Module 3

Some of these questions are from this week, some are from previous weeks, and some are new concepts. Try answering without research first. If you are not sure, take a guess but acknowledge that it's a guess (faking an answer in an interview without acknowledging it as a guess is a bad idea). Follow up with the necessary research to understand these concepts. These tend to be common themes during the job hunt and are worth having a solid understanding of.

1. What's OAuth?
2. What are some advantages/disadvantages of implementing OAuth?
3. What are the four pillars of object oriented design? How do they apply when creating:

  * PORO's with the data received from an API?
4. What do we use VCR for? Why is it a good idea to use this tool?
5. What does HTTP stand for?
6. What class does `ApplicationController` inherit from when creating a Rails project with the `--api` flag? What about without the `--api` flag?
  * What is `protects_from_forgery`?
  * What do you need to do differently for your API to accept non-GET requests if you did not use the --api flag?
7. How do you create the following table in SQL? In Active Record?   
   (Users table with columns first_name, last_name, email, and age)   
8. What does `inject` do? How should you use it?
